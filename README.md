# Scalable platform for real-time monitoring of machine tools

The code is developed to monitor an aeronautical machining process in real-time and detect outliers.

Regarding the experiments conducted with Spark Structured Streaming, an article has been published in the [Computers in Industry]([https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5694](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166361523002154)) journal, where a platform collects data from a machine, processes it, and displays visualizations in a dashboard along with the results.
